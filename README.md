# Calculator

This repository hosts one possible implementation of the _sample_ containerized application problem (calculator) for TechJam2019 Code Track. [[Problem Statement]](https://www.techjam.tech/__tj2019/deep_code/calculator.pdf) [[API Specification]](https://www.techjam.tech/__tj2019/deep_code/calculator_spec.html)

Particularly, this implementation is _incomplete_: only the baseline feature and feature extension A were implemented. It also lacks proper error handling in good software development.
